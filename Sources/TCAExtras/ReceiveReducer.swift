/// ## Example
/// ```swift
/// @Reducer
/// struct MyFeature {
///   ...
///   enum Action: ReceiveAction {
///     case receive(TaskResult<ReceiveAction>)
///
///     @CasePathable
///     enum ReceiveAction {
///       case numberFact(String)
///     }
///
///     ...
///   }
///
///   @Dependency(\.logger) var logger
///
///   public var body: some ReducerOf<Self> {
///     ReceiveReducer { state, action in
///       // Handle the success cases by switching on the receive action.
///       switch action {
///       case let .numberFact(fact):
///         state.numberFact = fact
///         return .none
///       }
///     }
///     .onFail(.log(logger: logger))
